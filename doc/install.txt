============================
Download and install Ximenez
============================

Supposing you have installed `Python`_, you can install Ximenez via an
egg with ``easy_install`` or from the sources if you prefer it the old
way.

.. _Python: http://python.org


Install via an egg
==================

This is the recommended method. 

If you need to install ``easy_install``, see `easy_install
installation page`_. If you do not want to bother reading this page,
here is a shorter how-to::

    $ wget http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py
    $ python ez_setup.py

Now that you are ready:

1. Make sure that your ``easy_install`` installation is up to date by
   running::

    $ easy_install -U setuptools

2. Then run the following command::

    $ easy_install ximenez

That's it.

.. _`easy_install installation page`: http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#installing-easy-install


Install "the old way"
=====================

If you do not want to use ``easy_install``, you can use the
"traditional" method:

1. Download sources (either from the `latest tarball`_ or from the
   `SVN repository`_).

2. Run::

    $ python setup.py build

3. And then run (you may need to be a super-user to do that)::

    $ python setup.py install

.. _`latest tarball`: /ximenez/files/ximenez-latest.tar.gz
.. _`SVN repository`: https://svn.pilotsystems.net/projets/ximenez


Test your installation
======================

You should now have:

- a new ``ximenez`` Python library which you can import:

.. sourcecode:: pycon

    >>> import ximenez

- a ``ximenez`` program which may or may not be in your path,
  depending on your installation.
