Ximenez : a multi-purpose action performer
==========================================

The purpose of Ximenez is to execute an action on a set of collected
items. Both the action and the way items are collected, are defined by
Python modules, which are called plug-ins. This lets you:

- execute a command (and retrieve its output) on a set of remote hosts
  (via SSH);

- perform various actions on a set of Zope servers (add an user,
  change his/her password, remove an user, etc.);

- carry out any action that you are willing to write a Python plug-in
  for.

See the `Plug-ins`_ section below to know more about Ximenez built-in
plug-ins and how to develop your own ones.


.. warning::

    Ximenez is already used in production. However, some action
    plug-ins have known bugs. For example, Zope-related action
    plug-ins fail in certain cases. If you encounter bugs, make sure
    that you are using the trunk (see `Subversion repository`_ section
    below) and contact the author: someone might very well be working
    on a fix.


Usage
-----

You can use Ximenez with the following command-line::

    $ ximenez -c <collector> -a <action>

``<collector>`` and ``<action>`` are both plug-ins. The former gives
Ximenez a set of items on which to act, and the latter is the action
to perform on each item of this set.

Hopefully, Ximenez comes with a number of useful plug-ins , e.g.::

    $ ximenez -c misc.readlines -a misc.print

Optional arguments are available. See `usage`_ for further
details.

Plug-ins
--------

The main characteristic of Ximenez is that it can be extended to just
do what you need to do, by using plug-ins. There are two kinds of
plug-ins: collectors and actions.

Ximenez ships with a set of `built-in plug-ins`_. You may also want to
take a loo at the `exhaustive guide`_ to develop your own plug-ins.

.. _exhaustive guide: develop-plugins.txt


Requirements
------------

Ximenez should run under any OS, though some plug-ins may use
OS-specific features or require special Python packages.

Python 2.3 or above is required. This program may also work with prior
versions of Python, though it has not been tested.


Installation
------------

If you have ``easy_install``, then the following should do the trick::

    $ easy_install Ximenez

For further details, see the `Installation`_ chapter

.. _Installation: install.txt


Subversion repository
---------------------

Ximenez source code lives in a Subversion repository. To checkout the
trunk::

    $ svn co https://svn.pilotsystems.net/projets/ximenez/trunk

You can also `browse the sources`_ with the same URL.
