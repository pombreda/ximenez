=========================
Ximenez built-in plug-ins
=========================

The main characteristic of Ximenez is that it can be extended to just
do what you need to do, by using plug-ins. There are two kinds of
plug-ins: collectors and actions.

Ximenez ships with a set of built-in plug-ins. They are described
below.


Collectors
==========

Built-in collectors are:

Miscellaneous
-------------

``misc.readlines``
  Collects values from a file (the values are the content of each
  line).


SSH
---

``ssh.readlines``
  Collects a set of remote hosts from a file. Each line of the file
  should be of the form ``<host>[:<ssh-port>]``).


Zope
----

``zope.readlines``
  Collects a set of Zope instances from a file. Each line of the file
  should be of the form ``<host>:<http-port>``).

``zope.instances``
  Collects a set of Zope servers from an user's input.


Actions
=======

Built-in actions are:

Miscellaneous
-------------

``misc.log``
  Logs (prints) each collected item. It can be quite useful when you
  are debugging a collector.


SSH
---

``ssh.remoteaction``
  Executes a command on the collected set of remote hosts (via SSH)
  and returns its output.


Zope
----

``zope.adduser``
  Adds a new user in the collected set of Zope instances.

``zope.chpwduser``
  Changes an user's password in the collected set of Zope instances.

``zope.rmuser``
  Removes an user in the collected set of Zope instances.


Developing your own plug-ins
============================

There is an `exhaustive guide`_ to develop your own plug-ins.
