Ximenez built-in plug-ins
=========================

The main characteristic of Ximenez is that it can be extended to just
do what you need to do, by using plug-ins. There are two kinds of
plug-ins: collectors and actions.

Ximenez ships with a set of built-in plug-ins. They are desribed below.


Collectors
----------

Built-in collectors are:

``misc.readlines``
  Collect values from a file (the values are the content of each
  line).

``ssh.readlines``
  Collect a set of remote hosts from a file. Each line of the file
  should be of the form ``<host>[:<ssh-port>]``).

``zope.readlines``
  Collect a set of Zope instances from a file. Each line of the file
  should be of the form ``<host>[:<http-port>]``).

``zope.instances``
  Collect a set of Zope servers from an user's input.


Actions
-------

Built-in actions are:

``misc.print``
  Logs (prints) each collected item. It can be quite useful when you
  are debugging a collector.

``ssh.remoteaction``
  Execute a command on the collected set of remote hosts (via SSH) and
  return its output.

``zope.adduser``
  Add a new user in the collected set of Zope instances.

``zope.chpwduser``
  Change password of an user in the collected set of Zope instances.

``zope.rmuser``
  Remove an user in the collected set of Zope instances.
