List of changes in Ximenez versions
===================================

What's new in Ximenez 0.9 (revision FIXME)
------------------------------------------

- usual errors are now caught by the Zope-related plug-ins. They now
  log meaningful messages in most cases;

- behaviour of the "add user" Zope plug-in has changed for non-PAS
  user folders. Before, this plug-in could replace an existing user
  (this is a feature/bug of the Zope user folder). It now raises an
  exception when we try to add an user that already exists;

- mock objects (fake logger and fake input) have been moved to their
  own modules, making them reusable. They also have their own
  doctests;

- tests coverage is near 100%;

- documentation has been updated.


What's new in Ximenez 0.8 (unreleased)
--------------------------------------

- added a set of tests. Still incomplete, but ready to be written. ;)

- replaced hand-made ``log`` module by standard ``logging`` package;

- reviewed docstrings;

- ``Collector`` and ``Action`` suffixes were removed from collectors
  and actions classes names.


What's new in Ximenez 0.7 (unreleased)
--------------------------------------

- made changes to the code so that Ximenez can be installed (and not
  only used from the source directory);

- arranged and augmented documentation.


What's new in Ximenez 0.6 (unreleased)
--------------------------------------

- added logging-related features.
