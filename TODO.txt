- write more tests

- remove 'VERSION.txt'

- use 'optparse' instead of 'getopt'

- regenerate "doc/api"

- add better error handling in 'main()' and/or in the plug-ins
  themselves. At least, I would like a global "try:... except:..."
  clause in 'xim.py:main()'.

- add plug-in listing features, and "introspection" of the available
  plug-ins (by printing the docstring of the plug-ins, for example).
