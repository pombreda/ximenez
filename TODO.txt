- release it

- use 'optparse' instead of 'getopt'

- add the ability to process all collected items concurrently (ant not
  iteratively, as it is now). I have ideas and running prototype code
  for that.

- add plug-in listing features, and "introspection" of the available
  plug-ins (by printing the docstring of the plug-ins, for example).
